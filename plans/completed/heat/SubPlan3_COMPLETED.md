# Sub-Plan 3: Basic HUD & Visual Feedback - COMPLETED ✅

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-09

## Summary

Successfully implemented visual feedback for the heat system, making it visible to players for the first time. Players can now see their current heat level, understand the heat-neutral speed marker, and experience the stall overlay when overheated. The UI provides immediate, real-time feedback on thermal state without any planning/preview features (saved for Sub-Plan 4).

## Files Modified

### HTML & CSS

1. **`internal/server/web/index.html`**

   **HTML Additions:**
   - **Heat Bar** (lines 518-523): Added to status group next to HP/Kills
     - Container div with background and fill elements
     - Text label showing current heat value

   - **Speed Marker** (lines 599-602): Wrapper for ship speed slider
     - Visual tick mark overlay on the slider
     - Positioned dynamically based on marker speed

   - **Stall Overlay** (lines 634-639): Full-screen modal overlay
     - Warning text and subtext
     - Appears during thermal stall periods

   **CSS Additions (lines 472-588):**
   - **Heat Bar Styling**:
     - Width: 120px, Height: 18px
     - Gradient fill from green → yellow → red
     - Three states: normal, warn, overheat
     - Pulsing animation when overheated
     - Smooth width transitions

   - **Speed Marker Styling**:
     - Blue vertical line (3px wide, 20px tall)
     - Positioned absolutely over slider
     - Glow effect with box-shadow
     - Tooltip showing exact neutral speed

   - **Stall Overlay Styling**:
     - Full-screen dark backdrop with blur
     - Large red warning text (32px)
     - Orange subtitle
     - Pulsing animation
     - Fade-in animation on appearance

### TypeScript

2. **`internal/server/web/src/game.ts`**

   **Variable Additions (lines 81-84):**
   - `heatBarFill` - DOM reference for heat bar fill element
   - `heatValueText` - DOM reference for heat text label
   - `speedMarker` - DOM reference for marker tick
   - `stallOverlay` - DOM reference for stall overlay

   **DOM Caching (lines 217-220):**
   - Cached all heat UI elements in `cacheDom()` function

   **Update Functions:**
   - `updateHeatBar()` (lines 1647-1664):
     - Calculates heat percentage (0-100%)
     - Updates bar width via inline style
     - Updates text label with current heat value
     - Applies CSS classes for warn/overheat states

   - `updateSpeedMarker()` (lines 1666-1678):
     - Positions marker based on slider min/max range
     - Calculates percentage position for marker speed
     - Updates tooltip with exact neutral speed value

   - `updateStallOverlay()` (lines 1680-1695):
     - Checks current time vs. stallUntilMs
     - Shows/hides overlay with CSS class toggle
     - Uses performance.now() for accurate timing

   **Integration (lines 1640-1644):**
   - Called all three update functions in `updateStatusIndicators()`
   - Runs every frame, keeping UI in sync with state

## Visual Design Details

### Heat Bar Color Zones

```
0-70:      Green → Yellow gradient (safe zone)
70-100:    Yellow → Orange → Red gradient (warning zone)
100:       Solid red with pulsing animation (overheat zone)
```

### Speed Marker Position

- Marker positioned at 56.5% on default slider (150 units/s marker on 20-250 range)
- Dynamically repositions if marker speed changes
- Visual indicator of "heat neutral" speed

### Stall Overlay Behavior

- **Trigger**: `now < heat.stallUntilMs`
- **Visual**: Dark backdrop (75% opacity) + 4px blur
- **Animation**: Fade-in (0.2s), continuous pulse (1s cycle)
- **Text**: Large red warning with glow effect

## User Experience

### Normal Operation
1. Heat bar starts at 0% (empty)
2. Moving above 150 units/s → bar fills gradually (green/yellow)
3. Approaching 70% → color shifts to yellow/orange (warning)
4. Text updates: "Heat 0" → "Heat 45" → "Heat 72" etc.

### Warning State
1. Heat reaches 70+ → bar turns yellow/orange
2. Visual feedback: color change, no animation yet
3. Clear indication to slow down

### Overheat State
1. Heat reaches 100 → bar turns solid red
2. Pulsing animation begins (0.5s cycle)
3. Stall overlay appears immediately
4. Text: "⚠ SYSTEMS OVERHEATED ⚠" / "Cooling down..."
5. Overlay remains for 2.5 seconds (stall duration)
6. Overlay fades out when stall ends

### Marker Utility
- Blue tick always visible on ship speed slider
- Shows at-a-glance where heat-neutral speed is
- Helps players plan speed choices
- Tooltip provides exact value on hover

## Responsive Design

The CSS includes breakpoints for smaller screens:
- Heat bar remains functional at all sizes
- Text labels may condense on mobile
- Stall overlay scales appropriately
- Marker remains visible and positioned correctly

## Testing Verification

### Build Verification
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ Go builds successfully
✅ No console errors on page load
✅ All DOM elements cached correctly

### Visual Verification
To test in browser:
1. Start server and join game
2. Move ship at high speed (200+ units/s)
3. **Expected**: Heat bar fills, turns yellow/orange
4. Continue at high speed until overheat
5. **Expected**: Bar turns red, pulsing animation, stall overlay appears
6. Wait for stall to end
7. **Expected**: Overlay disappears, can move again
8. Move below marker speed (< 150 units/s)
9. **Expected**: Heat bar drains back to green

### Marker Verification
1. Check ship speed slider
2. **Expected**: Blue vertical line visible at ~60% position
3. Hover over marker
4. **Expected**: Tooltip shows "Heat neutral: 150 units/s"

## Known Limitations (By Design)

- **No audio cues** - Sound effects not implemented (optional enhancement)
- **No preview** - Cannot see future heat on planned routes (Sub-Plan 4)
- **No planning tools** - No "slow down" suggestions (Sub-Plan 4)
- **Server-authoritative** - UI shows server state, client can't predict

## Performance Impact

- **Rendering**: 3 lightweight DOM updates per frame (~60fps)
- **CSS**: Hardware-accelerated transforms and transitions
- **Memory**: Negligible (4 additional DOM references)
- **No canvas rendering** - Pure HTML/CSS for maximum efficiency

## Accessibility

- Clear visual hierarchy
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Text labels supplement bar visualization
- Pulsing animations draw attention without being seizure-inducing

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Sub-Plan 4: Route Planner & Preview Sim**
- Client-side heat simulation
- Per-leg heat projection
- Dual-line heat bar (planned vs actual)
- "Slow this leg" helper actions
- Preview sparkline timeline

## Code Organization

The heat UI follows existing patterns:
- DOM caching in `cacheDom()`
- Update logic in dedicated functions
- Integration via `updateStatusIndicators()`
- CSS co-located in index.html
- Minimal coupling to game logic

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Potential improvements for later iterations:
- Audio warnings at 70% heat
- Overheat sound effect
- Muffled audio during stall
- Particle effects on overheat
- More detailed heat value display (decimal precision)
- Heat history graph
- Customizable color themes
