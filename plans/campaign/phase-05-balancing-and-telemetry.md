# Phase 5 – Balancing & Telemetry

## Goals

- Tune difficulty, pacing, and reward cadence using structured playtests and telemetry.
- Verify performance and stability under sustained campaign play with multiple concurrent encounters.
- Finalize QA coverage for beacon flow, missions, and progression to prepare for release.

## Key Deliverables

- Lightweight telemetry/logging capturing beacon activation timing, mission success/failure rates, heat spikes, and player deaths.
- Automated soak tests or headless simulations that run campaign seeds and report survivability metrics.
- Balancing passes on spawn density, heat parameters, reward frequency, and director pacing knobs.
- Regression checklist covering networking payloads, persistence, and UI flows introduced in prior phases.

## Backend Focus

- Diagnostic hooks emitting structured logs or metrics (behind dev build flags) without bloating release builds.
- Simulation harness for running scripted campaign scenarios; integrate with CI if possible.
- Performance profiling of beacon triggers, mission validation, and encounter spawning under load.

## Frontend Focus

- Developer-only overlays displaying mission timers, beacon cooldowns, and encounter budgets to accelerate tuning.
- Telemetry toggles within debug menus to help designers capture targeted metrics during playtests.
- Polish pass on HUD readability and audio mixing based on feedback loops from telemetry and playtest notes.

## Dependencies & Risks

- Accurate balancing depends on Phase 3 reward scaling and Phase 4 content breadth; incomplete content will skew telemetry.
- Telemetry must remain opt-in or stripped in production builds to maintain performance and privacy expectations.
